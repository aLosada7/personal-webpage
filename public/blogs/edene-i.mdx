## What is Edene?

This is the main question I want to answer in this blog, and the main reason why this has to be the first post of the series.

Edene born as a React component library, but nowadays it is much more. Edene aims to give you eveything you need to create a Design System by creating a visual consistency. The result is a set of standards to manage design at scale where you can be focused on creating beautiful user experience.

If we dig into the project, Edene is made up of a set of libraries: the foundations (core) which contains all the guides and tokens needed to design your product, and three different implementation, with each of them giving meaning to the fundamentals.

The first of this implementations (libraries) consist of a list of completely customizable and reusable React _components_. Secondly, a collection of _animations_ to create even more beautiful user experiences. Finally, a list of React hooks which will be used along with the components or on its own account. This last library is the only one fully independent of the foundations. There could exist others implementations in the future, For example, new component libraries for other frameworks like Angular or useful utilities for testing.

The following image shows a graph with the actual dependences between the existant libraries.

As you can see below right, there is one more library I have not mentioned before, called _utils_, which for now only provides test and repository funcionality (ame although it is not published, it still appears on the dependency graph).

This graph is the result of a large amount of analysis and testing going from a completely disorganised repository to a clear distinction between each of the libraries and their responsibilities.

## Why a monorepo, and particularly Nx, solved the worst problems

The monorepo is just the last step that gave me full confidence that the correct abstractions have been made. I started this project several months ago already using a monorepo, but with the idea in mind of having a single library which will contain Edene. There will be a couple of applications for testing purposes. But after not too long I realised I was not exploiting the full potential of Nx.

### Consistency

A Design System can be defined as a collection of specifications describing a set of design primitives, reusable components, and arbitrary guidelines to ensure consistency and visual identity.

That means must a Design System does not mean only a “component library”, it goes further than that.

As I explained before, one of the first objectives was to separate what gives your app an identity (core variables/tokens, assets, …) from the different implementations. This is because frameworks have a lifetime, and although React looks set to be a long haul, we never know which framework we will be working tomorrow.

I am actually working a lot with React, and that’s why the first two implementations are two React libraries: one for components and another for hooks. This means it’s highly likely that in the future new implementations can be introduced, for Angular, Vue or any other web-tech. Another possibility would be to create a new library for common components that are shared across multiple mobile apps. This is what Spotify does with [Encore](https://spotify.design/article/reimagining-design-systems-at-spotify).

Having that in mind, I tried to keep a loosely coupled architecture that would allow a new implementation to be introduced more easily.

### Flexibility

Nx allow you to start working in a new library in just a few minutes, thanks to its advanced code generator tools. This will also help you to add normalisation to your code at the same time you make it much more readable. You can add some configuration to improve your code quality. One of this aspects is eslint. You can add some new rules to improve core writting or simply follow Nx default preset and start working right after creating your library.

### All in one

For Edene, I had an idea in mind in which there would be several applications: an application that would bring together the documentation (_edene-docs_), a set of example templates (_edene-template_) focused on the visual part, and there would be others which will include business logic (f*ood-delivery*). All of these applications will be using the different libraries (_core_, _components_) and have all of these updated independently would be very expensive (even more for one programmer). Bringing all together every single application is updated when any change occurs in any of the libraries on which they depend. This is also important to catch visual bugs by comparing the actual expected behaviour before the apps is deployed in production.

### Automation

To speed up your workflow and ship higher quality code is necessary because reviewing code may not be sufficient to ensure that a pull request won’t break production .

For Edene, I am using GitHub Actions for now. It gives me all the necessary to introduce Continuous Integration (CI). At this point, it automatically run comprehensive UI test and deploys documentation, the Storybook and an example application.

## Edene current status

After so much work, trial and error, I have reached a point where I truly believe the project is completely scalable, and working at it is comfortable for the programmer. Besides this, a project must be easy to contribute if you want it to success, and anyone could contribute from a small think to even a new implementation. There is some work left in guides for contributing it is just a matter of time to improve documentation.

On the other hand, and specifically speaking about the monorepo, I have to raise my voice and say that the use of Nx Console VS extension has given me total control over the projects and the apps at the monorepo, keeping test or linting at the top of his view. [This blog](https://medium.com/nrwl/the-butterfly-effect-how-we-gave-linter-100x-boost-71a516750d19) shows an example of how simple they got a significant improvement in their linter rule. I follow the project closely and I know the team behind it is putting in a lot of effort to improve performance of every single process they implement.

The following image shows an example of how easy it is to manage each of the libraries and applications thanks to this VS extension.

## Final words

After being working for months in this project, I had to admit I past hard times when struggled with architecture, organization or consistency. After putting a lot of efforts, I can say a monorepo tool as _Nx_ has been **key** given me all the necessary to take the project to another level, making it at the same time **“reachable”.** Although the complexity is still high, the project is now easily scalable and highly flexible.

The challenges ahead consist of introducing more tests following different [UI Testing Handbook](https://storybook.js.org/tutorials/ui-testing-handbook/react/en/introduction/) concepts. This tutorial made me understand how to face testing in the framework. Apart from this, I want to introduce more components and contemplate more use cases, add new interfaces to the template with graphs and other complex elements and improve the documentation.

As I had previously published on Linkedin, I am actively looking for contributors and companies that want to use Edene and take it to the new level.
