Nx ([nx.dev](http://nx.dev)) aims to develop complex an scalable applications being these more maintainable and with more developers working on them.

Developed by Google and used by themselves, Microsoft, Facebook and another big companies to manage complexity by applying best practices.

## Advantages of the monorepo

-   Faster development
-   Helps us to manage complexity: Share interfaces, collaboration between team members (organisation-wide best practices), ...
-   Scalable, also helping to share code between projects
-   For example, lint, prettier and config editor working together for all projects ([https://blog.theodo.com/2019/08/why-you-should-use-eslint-prettier-and-editorconfig-together/](https://blog.theodo.com/2019/08/why-you-should-use-eslint-prettier-and-editorconfig-together/))
-   Cross-cutting dependencies, builds, test coverage, ...

## Creating a library

First of all, let's create a new workspace running:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace monorepo-library
```

Most important folders are _apps_ and _libs_ directories, where all our applications and utilities will reside.

Let's create a library which will **share** common helpoer functions to be used in different front-end projects.. A monorepo it is also very useful to share TS interfaces between your front-end and your back-end code. We can also create a library will contain a **design system** created for example, with Storybook. ~~(storybook blog)~~

To archieve this, we first have to add a plugin which supports React in our monorepo. Run:

```bash
ng add @nrwl/react
```

We can select cypress for testing and there are other options, but we are just going to make a first approach in this post. It's very easy to configure stuff like cypress, lint and other stuff and if you have any doubt, don't hesitate to contact me.

As we are using Typescript for this project, there is a lot of steps involved you need to set up. Fortunatelly, Nx takes care of this so you can focus on the most important part, developing.

If we export a component or a helper function, we can use it from any application. Let's check this works.

## Using this library from an application inside the monorepo
