## Nx: my favourite tool to introduce a testable UI architecture

Nx ([nx.dev](http://nx.dev)) aims to develop complex an scalable applications being these more maintainable at the same time the number of developers working on it grows.

Developed by Google and used by themselves, Microsoft, Facebook and another big companies to manage complexity by applying best practices.

## Advantages of the monorepo

-   Faster development and flexibility
-   Improves code organization
-   Reduces complexity
-   Scalable, with the possibility to share code between projects
-   Enforces best practices. As an example, lint, prettier and a config editor file are introduced in all projects ([https://blog.theodo.com/2019/08/why-you-should-use-eslint-prettier-and-editorconfig-together/](https://blog.theodo.com/2019/08/why-you-should-use-eslint-prettier-and-editorconfig-together/))
-   Cross-cutting dependencies, faster builds (cache), test coverage and other tools

## Creating a library

Creating an scalable application it’s one of the keys for the project success. If you are lucky enough that you application start growing, there will be a time when it has no sense to have all the logic together.

Libraries can help us to decrease coupling and reduce maintenance.

If this is your first time using Nx, you can create a new workspace running:

```bash
npx create-nx-workspace monorepo-library
```

Taking a look at the scaffolding generated, the folders you will be working the most are _apps_ and _libs_ directories, where all our applications and utilities will reside.

I will show you how duplication is reduced in a minute. Let's create a library which will **share** common helpers functions to be used in different front-end projects (as much as you want, independently they use Angular, React or other framework) A monorepo tool like Nx can be also very useful to share TS interfaces between your front-end and your back-end code, coding this way just once. Anorther application you can give to a library is to contain a **Design System.** In this case, I recommend you to use Storybook ([https://storybook.js.org/](https://storybook.js.org/))

Imagine we want to introduce pagination to a table and we need to ask backend for certain items passing limit and offset values. In the first module we have created we want to ask for the 20 first results, and so on. But we have another module which requires to show a list with at least 80 values, because items which be show 4 by 4. We can create an interface which declares this properties, and also a function which will be helpful to adapt filter values.

```tsx
interface IFilter {
	limit: number;
	offset?: number;
}

const listFilterAdapter = (filter?:IFilter): string => {
	if (!filter) return '';

	const queryParams = [];
	if (filter?.limit) queryParams.push(['limit, filter.limit]);
	if (filter?.offset) queryParams.push(['offset, filter.offset]);

	const queryString = queryParams.map((pair) => pair.join('=')).join('&');

	return `?${queryString}`;
}
```

As you see, interface and function can be used as many times as you want, and also in as many projects as exist in the monorepo. This is very useful and can reduce duplication.

## Creating your first application

Creating a new application will only take you a few seconds. In case we haven’t do this before, firstly we have to add a plugin which supports React in our monorepo. Run the following command:

```bash
ng add @nrwl/react
```

There are different options available. For example, you can create a Cypress folder if you want to add end-to-end test to your application. There are also another options, but we are just going to make a first approach in this post. It's very easy to configure stuff like cypress, lint and other stuff. If you have any doubt, don't hesitate to contact me.

As we are using Typescript for this project, there is a lot of steps involved you need to set up. Fortunatelly, Nx takes care of this so you can focus on the most important part, code.

Through an export you can use any components or function in any other library/application.

## Using a utility function from the new library in your application

At this moment, although we are only starting our application, we have isolated the business layer into a library, and the presentation it is only the UI framework. This is great, making both of our projects more testable.

What this means is that changing the framework won’t affect the logic, which will work under any framework.

I encorauge you to use the Nx Console extension for VSCode to add any project, including applications. You can click the button Generate, at the top right of the Nx console screen, which will take you a list of options where you can find your favourite front-end frameworks.

## Final thoughts

As a Front-end Engineer you should focus on creating scalable and maintable applications. The best way is to archive this is to think like a UI architect. You can start creating as many libraries as you want to host the business layer or your Design System. This way, you will have a testable application which also follow some of the best practices ensuring code quality.
