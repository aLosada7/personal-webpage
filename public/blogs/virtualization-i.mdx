> This is the first of two blog posts regarding virtualization in React

Virtualization can be defined as the creation of a virtual version of something. In the React context, it can be defined as the creation of a window that allows records to slide in and out of the view as the user scrolls through it. Virtualization can be really helpful reducing drastically the time your lists take to render, specifically when applied to long lists. This technique improves the performance of your web application. With virtualization, what matters the most is that there are only loaded into the virtual DOM those elements inside the viewport. React relies on the Virtual DOM to efficiently render only the components that have been updated.

Remember that this representation of the UI is syncronized afterwards with the “real” DOM using a [diffing algorithm](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html). This is made in React by ReactDOM library.

DOM updates might cause various problems (there are many others):

-   Slow initial rendering
-   Laggy scrolling

Thanks to virtualization, we face these two. Despite all the optimisations introduced by React, for highly-performant applications we may need more.

## DOM reflow & DOM repaint

DOM reflow & DOM repaint are two complex processes which explain better the cost of upgrading the real DOM.

**DOM reflow** is the process to figure out positions and sizes of each element, all child elements and its adjacents in the viewport. This is a really expensive process.

**DOM repaint** is the process where the nodes from the tree are converted to pixels on the screen. This is how visibility is archieve.

These two process are triggered every time there is an update to be made, what makes updating the DOM expensive for the web browser.

## React-window

[React-window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) comes as an open-source solution to face the problems caused when a huge number of elements have to be shown in the screen, tackling slow initial rendering and laggy scrolling. At the same time, helps virtualization, one of the biggest problems of highly-performant React application.

According to its creator, Brian Vaughn, react-window is a complete rewrite of [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) (which you may have heard about), faster and with a smaller bundler size. It constains all the essential functionalities of react-virtualized.

React-window can be used with other related libraries, maximizing its performance. Here are two of the most useful I have found.

-   Infinite Loader - Avoids oftaining data before its required (until you scroll to fit more)
-   Autosizer - Calculate the available viewport to adjust the number of elements which fit in the view

## Let’s do it

Let’s implement a simple virtualization list.T o use this all together, first you have to add to your project the following dependencies (rember to add the types if your project uses Typescript):

```bash
yarn add react-window react-virtualized-auto-sizer react-window-infinite-loader
yarn add -D @types/react-window @types/react-virtualized-auto-sizer @types/react-window-infinite-loader
```

### Virtual List component

The Virtual List component is complex, but once i has been understood you just have to use it properly to get the most from it.

```tsx
import { cloneElement, CSSProperties, forwardRef, ReactElement, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import { FixedSizeListProps, VariableSizeList } from "react-window";
import InfiniteLoader from "react-window-infinite-loader";
import AutoSizer from "react-virtualized-auto-sizer";

export interface VirtualListProps
	extends Omit<FixedSizeListProps, "children" | "innerElementType" | "height" | "width" | "itemSize" | "itemCount"> {
	hasNextPage: boolean;
	isNextPageLoading: boolean;
	items: unknown[];
	getItemsHeight?: (index: number) => number;
	itemSize?: number;
	loadNextPage: () => void;
	Row: ReactElement;
}

export interface VirtualListItemProps {
	index: number;
	style: Record<string, unknown>;
}

/**
 * The Inner component of the virtual list. This is the "Magic".
 * Capture what would have been the top elements position and apply it to the list.
 **/
const Inner = forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, React.HTMLProps<HTMLDivElement>>(function Inner({ children, ...rest }, ref) {
	return (
		<div {...rest} ref={ref}>
			<ul>{children}</ul>
		</div>
	);
});

function VirtualListRow({
	Row,
	isItemLoaded,
	index,
	style,
}: {
	isItemLoaded: (index: number) => boolean;
	Row: ReactElement;
	index: number;
	style: CSSProperties;
}) {
	if (!isItemLoaded(index)) return <div></div>;
	return cloneElement(Row, { index, style });
}

export default function VirtualList({
	// Are there more items to load?
	hasNextPage,

	// Are we currently loading a page of items?
	isNextPageLoading,

	// Array of items loaded so far.
	items,

	// Callback function responsible for loading the next page of items.
	loadNextPage,
	getItemsHeight,
	itemSize,
	Row,
}: VirtualListProps) {
	useEffect(() => {
		if (listRef && listRef.current && listRef.current.resetAfterIndex) {
			listRef.current.resetAfterIndex(0);
		}
	}, [items]);

	const listRef: any = useRef({});
	// If there are more items to be loaded then add an extra row to hold a loading indicator.
	const itemCount = hasNextPage ? items.length + 1 : items.length;

	// Only load 1 page of items at a time.
	// Pass an empty callback to InfiniteLoader in case it asks us to load more than once.
	// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-empty-function
	const loadMoreItems = isNextPageLoading ? () => {} : loadNextPage;

	const getItemHeight = (index: number) => {
		if (getItemsHeight) return getItemsHeight(index);

		return itemSize || 40;
	};

	// Every row is loaded except for our loading indicator row.
	const isItemLoaded = (index: number) => !hasNextPage || index < items.length;

	return (
		<AutoSizer>
			{({ height, width }) => (
				<InfiniteLoader isItemLoaded={isItemLoaded} itemCount={itemCount} loadMoreItems={loadMoreItems}>
					{({ onItemsRendered }) => (
						<VariableSizeList
							height={height}
							itemCount={itemCount}
							itemSize={getItemHeight}
							onItemsRendered={onItemsRendered}
							ref={listRef}
							width={width}
							innerElementType={Inner}
						>
							{({ index, style }) => (
								<VirtualListRow isItemLoaded={isItemLoaded} Row={Row} index={index} style={style} />
							)}
						</VariableSizeList>
					)}
				</InfiniteLoader>
			)}
		</AutoSizer>
	);
}
```

Let’s break it down:

-   I have defined the **VirtualListProps** interface in which I omit (Omit/< Type, Keys />). contrary to Pick, removes from all the properties of type the keys selected), defining also the following parameters
    -   hasNextPage → a boolean value which sets is there are more results available to be loaded. This information usually comes from the most recent API request
    -   isNextPageLoading → a boolean value to know if new results are currently being fetched. This may be an in-flight flag in your Redux store for example, or it can be provided by swr
    -   items → the array of items loaded so far. It is typed to unknown because it is the responsibility of the programmer to establish its type
    -   getItemsHeight → a function to get the approximately height of an item
    -   itemSize? → the exact height of an item if it is possible to be known
    -   loadNextPage → the callback triggered when more items need to be loaded
    -   Row → a ReactElement containing the item content
-   **VirtualListItemProps** contains the properties for each item row. Includes the index (to be searched on the list) and the styles to paint it correctly.
-   The **Inner** component basically wraps the list
-   The **VirtualListRow** component creates a row for each existant element (meaning it has an index)
-   The **VirtualList** component itself, exported as default, puts together the Autosizer, the variable list and the virtual row. It also calculates the item height and triggers the callback when necessary.

### Functionallity to get the list of items

I am using **swr/infinite** to get an infinite list of items from a fake API I found on the Internet. I have created a custom hook which returns all the necessary to construct the list. We could also return a property to know if there is next page, but with API I know it will.

```tsx
import axios from "axios";
import useSWRInfinite from "swr/infinite";

import { IUserBase } from "../model/user";

const SWR_KEY = "users";

export interface IUseUserList {
	list?: IUserBase[];
	total: number;
	error?: Error;
	loading: boolean;
	size: number;
	setSize: (arg0: number) => void;
}

export const useUserList = (): IUseUserList => {
	const getKey = (pageIndex: number, previousPageData: string | any[]) => {
		// check if end has been reached
		if (previousPageData && !previousPageData.length) return null;
		return `/${SWR_KEY}?page=${pageIndex}`;
	};

	const fetcher = (): any => {
		return axios.get(`https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/${SWR_KEY}?page=${size}`).then((res) => res.data);
	};

	const {
		data: list,
		error,
		isValidating,
		size,
		setSize,
	} = useSWRInfinite(getKey, fetcher, {
		revalidateFirstPage: false,
		revalidateAll: true,
	});

	return {
		list: (list || []).flat(),
		total: list ? list[0].total : 0,
		error,
		loading: isValidating,
		size,
		setSize,
	};
};
```

### A component which uses it

I created a container to wrap the data fetching functionality which directly calls a component in which the list is shown.

The UserItem uses the VirtualListItemProps to get the index and styles needed to place each item correctly on the screen.

```tsx
const UserItem = ({ index, style, ...props }: any) => {
	const user = props.list[index];

	return (
		<Wrapper style={style}>
			<Content>
				<h4>
					<b>{user.name}</b>
					<Badge status={user.status}>{user.status}</Badge>
				</h4>
				<p>{`${user.email} | ${user.gender.charAt(0).toUpperCase()}${user.gender.slice(1)}`}</p>
			</Content>
		</Wrapper>
	);
};
```

First, we get the item and after that we render our item. You can check out the full component code [here](https://github.com/aLosada7/react-virtualization/blob/master/src/user/components/UserListComponent.tsx).

The result is the following:

## Final words

Virtualization may seem challenging and complex at first, but once you understand how it works under the hood. I highly recommend you to invest time on implementing your own virtualized list, using react-virtualized or another library, as this complex concept will help you to understand a feature top-performant applications may implement.
